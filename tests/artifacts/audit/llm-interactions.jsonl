YAML generation blocked.\n  ```\n- Use the clarified answers to resolve ambiguities; never guess.\n- Scenario names must be concise, unique, and action-oriented (imperative voice).\n- Map each user interaction to a step `type` (`given`, `when`, `then`, `and`, `but`).\n- **CRITICAL**: Every step `text` field MUST match a pattern from the step vocabulary. Use the exact phrasing with parameter placeholders (e.g., `I am on the {page} page` becomes `I am on the login page`). If no vocabulary pattern fits, STOP and output an error.\n- Build the `selectors` map by referencing identifiers or ARIA roles from the clarifications/spec. If unknown, add a TODO comment in the `selectors` value.\n- Include a `metadata` section with exactly these fields:\n  - `specId`: Generate a random UUID v4\n  - `generatedAt`: Current ISO 8601 timestamp (e.g., `2025-10-18T12:00:00.000Z`)\n  - `llmProvider`: Use `codex`\n  - `llmModel`: Use `codex-typescript`\n- Use kebab-case selector IDs (e.g., `submit-button`).\n- Sanitize sensitive data by replacing secrets with descriptive placeholders (e.g., `<E2E_USER_EMAIL>`, `<E2E_USER_PASSWORD>`).\n\n# Output Format\n\n- Emit only raw YAML, no markdown fences or commentary.\n- Maintain two-space indentation.\n- Include `feature`, optional `description`, optional `background`, `scenarios` array, and `metadata`.\n- Each scenario entry must include:\n  - `name`\n  - optional `tags` array (lowercase hyphenated)\n  - `steps` array following the defined schema\n  - `selectors` map with every referenced selector ID\n  - optional `testData` record for reusable data\n\n# Quality Checklist\n\n- ✅ YAML passes the schema at `tests/schemas/yaml-spec.schema.json`.\n- ✅ All unanswered clarifications block output with the defined error message.\n- ✅ Every step `text` field matches a pattern from the step vocabulary (exact match with parameters filled in).\n- ✅ Every referenced selector appears in the `selectors` map.\n- ✅ No code fences, comments, or trailing whitespace.\n- ✅ Step text uses first-person imperative voice (e.g., \"I am on the login page\", not \"User is on the login page\").\n","response":"feature: Customer login\ndescription: Validate successful and failed login attempts for dashboard entry.\nscenarios:\n  - name: Successful login with valid credentials\n    steps:\n      - type: given\n        text: I am on the login page\n      - type: when\n        text: I enter email as \"qa.user@example.com\"\n        selector: email-input\n      - type: when\n        text: I enter password as \"SuperSecure123!\"\n        selector: password-input\n      - type: when\n        text: I click the submit button\n        selector: submit-button\n      - type: then\n        text: I should see text \"Welcome back\"\n        selector: dashboard-heading\n    selectors:\n      email-input: \"[data-testid='email-input']\"\n      password-input: \"[data-testid='password-input']\"\n      submit-button: \"button[aria-label='Sign in']\"\n      dashboard-heading: \"h1[aria-label='Welcome back']\"\nmetadata:\n  specId: \"11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111\"\n  generatedAt: \"2025-10-18T12:00:00.000Z\"\n  llmProvider: \"codex\"\n  llmModel: \"codex-typescript\"","cached":false,"promptHash":"14b8efebc2714e0496a1d59239a213b3d540be327bc80ddfe5b56fe02fdf81ff","metadata":{"specPath":"/tmp/pipeline-e2e-8gCgt4/qa-specs/example-login.txt","clarificationsPath":"/tmp/pipeline-e2e-8gCgt4/clarifications/example-login.md"}}

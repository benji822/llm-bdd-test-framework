# Knowledge Capture Workflow

I'll help you document this solution and capture it for team knowledge sharing.

## Phase 1: Solution Summary

First, let's summarize what we solved:

**Problem:**
[Brief description of the issue we solved]

**Root Cause:**
[What was actually causing the problem]

**Solution:**
[High-level description of how we fixed it]

**Files Changed:**
[List the key files that were modified]

## Phase 2: Technical Details

Now let's document the technical implementation:

**Code Changes:**
[Specific code changes made, with before/after examples]

**Configuration Updates:**
[Any environment variables, settings, or configurations changed]

**Dependencies:**
[New dependencies added or versions updated]

## Phase 3: Testing & Validation

Document how we verified the fix:

**Test Cases Added:**
[New tests written to prevent regression]

**Manual Testing:**
[Steps taken to verify the fix works]

**CI Validation:**
[How we ensured CI still passes]

## Phase 4: Knowledge Documentation

I'll create comprehensive documentation:

**Location:** `docs/knowledge/[topic]-[timestamp].md`

**Contents:**
- Problem statement with context
- Investigation process (Oracle + Librarian findings)
- Root cause analysis
- Solution implementation
- Testing approach
- Prevention measures
- Related issues and patterns

**Thread Sharing:**
- Set this thread to "Workspace-shared"
- Add link to the knowledge document
- Share in team communication channels

## Phase 5: Prevention & Monitoring

Finally, let's ensure this doesn't happen again:

**Code Patterns:**
[Any new patterns or best practices to adopt]

**Monitoring:**
[Metrics, logs, or alerts to add]

**Documentation Updates:**
[README, guides, or AGENTS.md updates needed]

This knowledge capture ensures our team learns from every issue and builds institutional knowledge over time.
